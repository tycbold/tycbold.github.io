		<h2>It even has subheadings</h2>
		<p>Here's a paragraph. The rest is gibberish I swear. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...Okay so Rich said he hates lorem ipsum so I'll use less of it here. I'll admit, I wanted to use a CSS gradient instead of just an rgba background color here, but I couldn't quite figure it out and the functionality seemed kinda complicated, so I put it on the back burner.</p>
		<p>So this paragraph also used to be comprised of lorem ipsum, but here's a real sentence for more filler!</p>
		<p>How many paragraphs do I need? Sounds more like a philosophical question. Is the universe real? What is true happiness?</p>
		<h3>Nifty!</h3>
		<p>More paragraphs, maybe as a wrap up. Or it's a mystery! Cool.</p>
